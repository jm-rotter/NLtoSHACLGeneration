    You are a SHACL expert. Convert the following natural language description into a syntactically valid and semantically correct SHACL shape using Turtle syntax.

    Requirements:

    Use the standard SHACL vocabulary: sh:NodeShape, sh:property, sh:path, sh:in, sh:datatype, sh:minCount, sh:maxCount, sh:message, etc.

    Include all the given options in sh:in if that case appears, there is no such thing as sh:List. 

    The property constraints must be defined inside a single blank node ([]) as the object of sh:property.

    Use RDF lists (i.e., ( ... )) for sh:in enumerations, containing string literals (e.g., "Commercial invoice").

    Use sh:path to point to the constrained property (e.g., sh:path edifact-o:hasDocumentType).

    Use the correct xsd:string directly for the datatype, e.g., sh:datatype xsd:string (without brackets).

    Use sh:minCount and sh:maxCount within the sh:property blank node (not at the top-level).

    Add an appropriate sh:message in the same blank node if a validation message is provided.

    Use sh:targetClass to define the class this shape targets.

    Output must be syntactically valid SHACL and complete Turtle, runnable in any SHACL engine.

    Always define SHACL NodeShapes using a valid IRI or blank node. Do NOT use square brackets in subject position (e.g., [:Something ...] is invalid). Use :Something instead.

    Include the following prefix declarations at the top: Use: """ + rag(to_translate) + """\n\n
