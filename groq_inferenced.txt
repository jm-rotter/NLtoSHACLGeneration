The SHACL shape :Dokumentenname targets all instances of the class edifact-o:InvoiceDetails. It specifies a property constraint on edifact-o:hasDocumentType that requires exactly one value (with minCount and maxCount set to 1). The value must be a string (xsd:string) and must be one of the predefined allowed values: "Commercial invoice", "Credit advice", "Value credit", "Value debit", "Handelsrechnung", "Gutschriftsanzeige", "Wertgutschrift", "Wertbelastung". If this property is missing or appears more than once, or its value is outside this list, validation will fail with the message: "Data element 1001 is missing in the BGM segment".

Either the organization does not have the RDF type "http://example.com/BuyerRole" or, if it does have the "http://example.com/BuyerRole" type, then the property p2p-o-org:VATIdentifier must be present exactly once (minimum count 1 and maximum count 1), and its value must be a string with a maximum length of 14 characters. If neither of these conditions is met (i.e., the organization is a buyer but the VAT identifier is missing or invalid), the validation will fail with the message: "The Segment RFF+VA is missing for the Segment NAD+BY, i.e. the buyer's VAT number is missing."

The SHACL shape :PLZLieferant applies to all instances of the class org:FormalOrganization. It specifies a validation rule with an sh:or condition. Either the organization does not have the RDF type "http://example.com/SupplierRole" or, if it does have the "http://example.com/SupplierRole" type, then the property vcard:postalCode must be present exactly once (minimum count 1 and maximum count 1), and its value must be a string with a maximum length of 9 characters. If neither of these conditions is met (i.e., the organization is a supplier but the postal code is missing or invalid), the validation will fail with the message: "The data element 3251 is missing for the Segment NAD+SU, i.e. specification of the supplier's postal code."

Either the organization does not have the RDF type "http://example.com/DeliveryPartyRole" or, if it does have the "http://example.com/DeliveryPartyRole" type, then the property frapo:hasCountryCode must be present exactly once (minimum count 1 and maximum count 1), its value must be a string (xsd:string) with a maximum length of 3 characters.

It specifies two property constraints: the property catalog:bundleItems must appear at least twice (minCount 2), and the property catalog:bundlePrice must have a value that is a non-negative float (xsd:float with minInclusive 0.0). If either of these conditions is not met, validation will fail with the message: "Bundle deals must include at least 2 items and a bundle price."

The SHACL shape :ProductDimensionShape applies to all instances of the class catalog:ProductDimension.

The SHACL shape :WarehouseDetailShape applies to all instances of the class catalog:WarehouseDetail. It specifies two property constraints, which must be satisfied simultaneously. The property catalog:locationCode requires a string value (xsd:string) with a minimum length of 2 characters. Additionally, the property catalog:temperatureControlled requires a boolean value (xsd:boolean). If either of these properties is missing or has an invalid value, validation will fail with the message: "Warehouse details must include a location code and whether it is temperature controlled."

The SHACL shape :ProductComparisonShape targets all instances of the class catalog:ProductComparison. It enforces a constraint that requires the presence of two distinct IRI values for the properties catalog:comparedProduct1 and catalog:comparedProduct2. Furthermore, it specifies a SPARQL-based validation rule that checks if the values of these two properties are not identical. If the values are the same or if either property is missing, the validation will fail with the message: "Comparison must involve two distinct products." or "Compared products must not be the same."

The SHACL shape :EducationGrantShape applies to all instances of the class civic:EducationGrant. It specifies two property constraints that must be satisfied simultaneously. Firstly, the property civic:grantAmount requires a value that is a float (xsd:float) with a minimum inclusive value of 100.0. Secondly, the property civic:fieldOfStudy requires a value that must be one of the following: "STEM", "Arts", "Law", "Medicine", or "Education". If either of these constraints is not met, validation will fail with the message: "Education grant must define amount (min €100) and field of study."

↓

The SHACL shape :TaxResidencyStatusShape applies to all instances of the class civic:TaxResidencyStatus. It specifies three constraints that must be simultaneously satisfied. 

Firstly, the property civic:daysPresent must have a value that is an integer (xsd:integer). 

Secondly, the property civic:isResident must have a value that is a boolean (xsd:boolean). 

Thirdly, a SPARQL constraint is defined that enforces a logical relationship between the values of civic:daysPresent and civic:isResident. Specifically, if the number of days present is more than 183, then the resident status must be true, and if the number of days present is less than or equal to 183, then the resident status must be false. 

If any of these constraints is violated, the validation will fail with one of the following messages: "Residency status must match days present in the country." or "A person is resident if present more than 183 days."
